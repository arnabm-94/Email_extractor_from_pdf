# Email_extractor_from_pdf
This code is a Python script that extracts email addresses from a PDF file using the pdfminer library and regular expressions.
This Python code extracts email addresses from a PDF document. It uses the pdfminer library to extract text content from the PDF and employs a regular expression pattern to locate email addresses within the extracted text. If email addresses are found, it prints the first one. The code defines two functions: one for extracting text from a PDF file and another for finding email addresses in the extracted text.
